    <h1>The first AR system</h1>
    <p>The first realisation this technology started with.</p>
    <p>Shortly thereafter, Sutherland constructed the first VR system. In 1968, he finished the first head-mounted display. <br>
      Because of its weight, it had to be suspended from the ceiling and was appropriately nicknamed “Sword of Damocles”. <br>
      This display already included head tracking and used see-through optics. </p>

    <h1>Advancing</h1>
    <p>People still keep trying to advance the technology to this day.</p>
    <p>Advances in computing performance of the 1980s and early 1990s were ultimately required for AR to emerge as an independent field of research. <br>
      Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Myron Krueger, Dan Sandin, Scott Fisher, and others had experimented with many concepts of mixing human interaction<br>
      with computer-generated overlays on video for interactive art experiences. <br>
      Krueger [1991], in particular, demonstrated collaborative interactive overlays of graphical annotations among participant silhouettes in his Videoplace installations around 1974.</p>

    <h1>Naming the technology</h1>
    <p>People needed an exact term for the technology, so it can spread much faster and that they can remember the name.</p>
    <p>The year 1992 marked the birth of the term “augmented reality.” <br>
      This term first appeared in the work of Caudell and Mizell [1992] at Boeing, which sought to assist workers in an airplane factory by displaying <br>
      wire bundle assembly schematics in a see-through HMD.</p>

    <h1>Latest steps</h1>
    <p>After a long time of advancing the technology and letting the name of it spread, companies managed to make profit out of it.</p>
    <p>The term augmented reality became better known to the mass market in spring 2012, when Google introduced Google Glasses, data glasses that did not meet  <br>
      all the criteria of the previously presented AR technology, but also added virtual information to reality. However, these glasses could not prevail,  <br>
      so the project was postponed in 2015. Nevertheless, Google stayed on the topic and in October 2014 invested an additional 500 million US dollars in the company Magic Leap, <br>
      which, according to its own statements, is developing revolutionary AR glasses. Microsoft is already one step further and has already brought <br>
      the first AR glasses onto the market with Microsoft Hololens.</p>
    <p>
      In the field of handheld AR systems, Nintendo, in cooperation with Niantic, triggered a real hype with the Pokémon Go smartphone app in summer 2016. <br>
      Within the first three months, the game, in which virtual characters can be caught in the real environment of the user, generated sales of over 600 million US dollars.</p>
