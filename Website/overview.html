    <h1>Meaning of Augmented Reality</h1>
    <p>Augmented Reality is a bigger step for the mankind than it would seem to be.</p>
    <p>The term augmented reality means “augmented reality” and is part of numerous different and sometimes contradicting definitions. <br>
      While virtual reality, following the pure sense of the word, could be understood as the perception of the virtual world, <br>
      augmented reality could be understood as the perception of the real world expanded (by virtual elements). </p>
    <p>It could be described with the following terms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">a technology</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">a field of research</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">a vision of future computing</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">an emerging commercial indsutry</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">a new medium for creative expression</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <p>Defining the core meaning of the expression.</p>
    <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment,<br>
      where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information. </p>
    <p>AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">a combination of real and virtual worlds</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">real-time interaction</li>
      <li class="generalMenuItem">accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It applies equally well to visuals that are optical see-throughs or rendered on monitors. <br>
      A movie such as Jurassic Park is not AR since it's not interactive for viewers.</p>

    <p>Since this definition requires 3D integration into a real environment, <br>
      2D overlays on live video are also excluded from AR. Some writers consider this as AR as well, calling it TV AR. <br>
      Augmenting live video with digital information for a sports game or a weather report would be considered TV AR.</p>

    <p>Others define AR in terms of the interfaces/hardware used. But conceptually, the definition is still includes merging the real <br>
      and the virtual while retaining presence and interaction with the real world.</p>

    <p>The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), <br>
       or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven <br>
        with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.</p>

    <p>In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, <br>
      whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one.</p>

    <h1>Tech overview</h1>
    <p>A quick overview on the technologies that are used for making Augmented Reality a real thing.</p>

    <p>Hardware components for augmented reality are: a processor, display, sensors and input devices.  <br>
      Modern mobile computing devices like smartphones and tablet computers contain these elements, which often include a camera and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) <br>
       sensors such as an accelerometer, GPS, and solid state compass, making them suitable AR platforms. </p>

    <p>Various technologies are used in augmented reality rendering, including optical projection systems, monitors, handheld devices, and display systems, <br>
       which are worn on the human body.</p>
